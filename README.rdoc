== README

The idea for this project is to bring together a number of tools that facilitate running a large organisation like GDS. Managing people, roles, communities, non-people costs, teams, groups, and goals.

== Status

Due to privacy complexity and the need to accredit heroku/etc, the financial planning piece has been paused.

Work is continuing on the Objectives & Key Results functionality.

== RUNNING LOCALLY

NOTE: This app is setup to run on Heroku. To run it locally, you MUST create a .env file like so:

BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=whatever
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=somepassword

To start the server use
$ heroku local

It also has a Procfile which you probably won't need to touch.

== TODO
- Search for role by name
- Make names click-able to search for all roles using that person
- Search for role by type
- Add non-people costs (EPIC)
- Make short_names for each GDS function unique (in DB and model)
- Write some tests!
- WRITE SOME TESTS!
- slugify functions by short name (e.g. /functions/dcp vs /funcitons/4)
- Filter to show vacant roles per Function (by month)
- Split allocation into separate table away from roles Stop using "hard-coded" months :(

== DONE
- Paginate full role listing
- Associate roles to functions (initially by function_name) w/ error reporting

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
